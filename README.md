# About
 Small todo list ( Single Page App ). The layout is separated into 5 columns for Monday through Friday, each column has a 'add todo' input element that uses jQuery to capture the input value on a users 'keypress' of the 'enter' or 'return' key. The captured value is appended below the appropriate day of the week as a 'todo list item'.

 Using jQuery-ui, the user is able to drag 'todo-list-items' to other days of the week, and each item is sortable within its column as well. Finally, a todo can be 'removed' from the App by dragging the item to the 'remove-todo-item' box.

 # Tools
